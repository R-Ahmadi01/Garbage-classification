# Garbage-classification
This repository provides a comprehensive pipeline for classifying garbage images into specific categories by leveraging the power of CLIP (Contrastive Languageâ€“Image Pretraining) and a custom neural network classifier. The project focuses on combining both image and text features for enhanced classification accuracy across four categories: Blue, TTR, Green, and Black.

 # 1. Introduction
 Garbage classification is a subcategory of supervised learning within machine learning. Deep learning models have demonstrated promising performance for this task [1]. Like other supervised learning tasks, garbage classification involves four fundamental steps: data collection, preprocessing, model selection, and evaluation. In this document, we will elaborate on these steps and address the key questions outlined in the course content for this assignment.
In Canada, particularly in Calgary, waste sorting is a critical part of waste management efforts. The system relies on different color-coded carts for specific types of waste. The black cart is intended for general garbage, the blue cart is for recyclables, and the green cart is for compostable materials such as food waste, soiled cardboard, and other compostable items. Additionally, certain disposables are color-coded red to indicate special handling. Figure 1 provides a more detailed guide on how to properly sort waste under this system.


This project demonstrates a deep learning approach for classifying objects based on both image and text inputs.
